Zach Grandell,"The first moment you guys released Dubstep Killed Rock and Roll. The start of something big. You guys are what got me into EDM. I didn't know there were so many different genres, and now all I want to do is one day be a producer. You guys are the best :D"

Corentin Vilsalmon,I made my lil' brother listen to Full Grizzly and he loved it. So now and then he comes back to talk about Monstercat. Really proud.

Luuk van der Flier,"To see the grow of artists. If you listen every song of a single artist and you start at the first one they made, and end at the most recent one you can hear them become better. Literally. 
So the best memory is the evolution of skill of the MCM crew."
Erik Huston,"The sheer emotion that was behind Tristam's song ""Truth."" Every time I listen to that song I can feel the effort and dedication he put into it."

Tanner Murphy,"probably that Monstercat helped me widen my love for electronic music. It's not about the beat or bang, but the emotion that a song delivers."
Jackson Buchanan,"Seeing my good friend Erik (Archie) get signed by you guys. As a fan of his music from the beginning, I was overcome with joy to see him get to that level."
Lawrence Hu,Meeting Ephixia in a plug.dj room and watching the entire room explode in a fanboy/fangirl frenzy. It was pretty funny. Monstercat's music is purely amazing.
Samuel Geddes-Smith,Ephixa going mental on social media and all ensuing hilarity.
Joseph Marley,"I enjoyed the experiences I've had were I got to chat with and design for some of the artist signed to your label. Monstercat is full of awesome, unique, and creative people!  :)"
Oscar Andrés Conteras,"All the great artists. I have discovered a lot of new producer's and I want to support them. Thank you for having such great artists. I wan to become a DJ too.

Erik Gallagher,The moment where I was wearing my Monstercat shirt at school and a kid with the same shirt came up to me and gave me the best fistbump ever and we became instant friends
Paul Bohn,"Twas a cold winters morning and I heard a noise outside my log cabin. Alas, a bear pounced upon me but unluckily for him I was listening to Self Destruct from Pegboard Nerds and I quickly wrestled him into submission. I then returned to my cabin and sipped some hot cider listening to the Mentalist. A fine day indeed."
Yan Montiero E Toledo,"I remember when i was playing CS 1.6 with my friends, i was doing pretty badly. Suddenly, a wild badass music appeared on my playlist, that song was Snake eyes, boom, first place on the scoreboard."

Nick Renaud,"Realizing that Monstercat is not just a part of life, but has become a way of life. Seeing this community grow from the little Monsterkitty it once was into the undisputed Monstercat has been astounding. All these artists are proof that we can all make a difference in life and that we all live our lives together. Truly inspiring and motivational to be living this experience!"
Jeremy Beaudoin,How everyone in the Family is growing bigger! Their songs being number 1 on beatport! Even for Varien! He's now starting release songs for games and already have done for a movie (so I herd from Himself) Just seeing the Family growing bigger every year and hearing their improvements on their songs makes me happy and im probably speaking for everyone else too. I just love the new artist that Monstercat Media has been bring into the family.
Chris Ng,When my friends got jealous because i had a monstercat shirt

Michael Morris, I worked at a Tech Camp this past summer teaching mostly teenagers/some younger kids. One of the counselors and I always had one of the GQ podcasts or a Monstercat Album Mix playing and we had a bunch of kids come up to us at the end and say hearing and learning about new music was the best part of the camp
Alexandre Coutinho,"the best thing that i did since i was born was following you on youtube
really
you have so many musics that inspire me everyday to go to school
and in the worst moments in my life the only thing that can cheer me up its your music
ty monstercat i really apreciate your work
stay cool :P"
Jonathan Boccardi,"To be honest, speaking to the artists on a personal level through plug.dj has been amazing. It's astonishing how such a massive label can have such a caring fan base and caring staff/artists/executives that aren't afraid to show their faces at events like these or in live streams... I've also been in situations in school where people have recognized my t-shirts, and I can speak to them about the label and the artists in real conversations, and I've been a fan since the very beginning... Day One. (lol xD) I'm just glad to be a part of the community we have created, and the family that has kept me entertained for the past year and a half."
Jacquine Mc-Staggot,"Besides almost every MC release?
One time, my phone went off in class. My ringtone was Self Destruct by Pegboard Nerds, my teacher knew the track and didn't take my phone because of it (my school has a rule against phones at school). After class, he got me out of History and we talked about Dubstep for almost a whole period. It was pretty awesome."
Juhani Toni Timonen,"When I put on some monstercat on my laptop and my friend who only lissens to electronic music and knows everything about it goes ""wait.. what is this? tell me right MEOW!"". For once I felt like I had something unique to share! Although I just sat there snickering and not telling for a while.."
Dana Marie Bourque,"Having the song ""Birthday Cake"" Come out on my birthday!"
Kyle Juhasz,"Wow where do I begin? Monstercat involves it's self with some of the best games out there! I remember watching the IPL5 League of Legends and they announced the commercial break. During the commercial break I was jamming out to Fire in the hole by Pegboard Nerds! My favorite game and favorite family of artists was overwhelming, that was my fondest memory."
Esa Kopsala,"That day when i first found Monstercat, i only listened 1 or 2 songs and i absolutely fell in love with you guys. Monstercat inspired me to start making my own music, and i'm still doing it. 
Hoping everyday that someday i will see new Monstercat video uploaded and it will say my name in it. Thank you! <3"
Jacob Jutras,getting ALL of my tattos whille listening to Monstercat releases and my Monstercat tattoo itself :D
Josh Stover,My fondest memory of being part of the amazing Monstercat Family is the inspiration that these young artists have given me. They get me through the day and through all my doubts. The best community I have ever been a part of. Thank you Monstercat.
Ben Townsend,Getting my new sound system in and testing it with the best of 2011 album! Had the walls shaking and things falling off of shelves :)
Ali Alhajaizi,"The best memory is finding out about Monstercat itself. It's an amazing company with talented artists, and the songs are the best you can find. There's nothing more enjoyable than looking forward to a new release, and listening to the amazing beat and unique melodies, while watching the bass line flop around like a fish!
Monstercat means so much to me, and I love everything about it, from the artists who reach out to their fans to the songs that make you feel alive and happy inside (or not, depending on the song). There's so much that this Label offers, from House to Dubstep to Nu-Disco, it's all there! And the greatest thing about it is that this is only the beginning, and the future will offer so much more.
So thank you, Monstercat, and your friendly and awesome community, for everything. <3"
Stefano Unia,"I remember that time when Reasons by Project 46 came out. It was so wild. Everyone wanted to get their own Monstercat Lanyards, like me. Then later the song blew up in Beatport. It was pretty exhilarating how the family worked together to make a 'movement'. I also remember how when you guys, Monstercat, uploaded that one song ""Yo! (The Killabits Remix)"" by Mart!n McFly and everyone went enraged. As funny as it was, I quickly realized that Monstercat and it's people are different from every other YouTube channel. We all might be different in the family, but together ""We Are One."""
Guillermo Falcon,"Slamed my face into my keyboard and look that up on youtube, for some reason it sent me to Waking Dreams By TwoThirds and now I LOVE MONSTERCAT MEDIA! Found you guys August of 2012 :P"
Joyce Lee,"When you overthrew Skrillex, deadmau5, Tiesto, and many others in Operation Dethrone. Monstercat should be that ambitious more often!"
Sohom Senn,"Well, I met a friend that was a DJ like me. We also had the same taste in music. From Dubstep to Trance, we loved them all. He recommended me to Monstercat, and litterally fell in love. I love the selection of Monstercat music, and I love the artist who take part in the label. Monstercat, you made me feel good about myself. A lot of these songs mean a lot to me. I feel connected to these songs. Flight, is something I listen to when I go to school. It makes me feel that I'm about to do something great. The flight to success in High School is tough, but this song helps me accomplished what there is to be done. All the mixes are fantastic too. I love when I think a song I didn't hear personally was in a mix. After I hear it in a mix I listen to that song only once again. After I knew you guys, I recommended the label to anyone I knew who like Dubstep, Electro, EDM, etc. I've been saving up for a Gold Pass so I can enjoy the quality of each song instead of through Youtube. Its really a privilege to listen to the label's music. Win the T-Shirt, or I don't, I know you guys are going to read this, so the thoughts that I have will definitely reach you. Thank You, Monstercat

A die hard fan of Monstercat since August 2012."

Michael Turnell," I found Monstercat a long while ago while not having the best times in my life. From hearing the first song I listened to (which I believe was a Tristam song) I feel in love with every track since. One of my fondest memories include spending a couple of hours listening to a ton of your songs with my friends while hanging out, another time I was feeling really depressed and Pegboard Nerds' Disconnected came on and lifted up my spirits a bit. All of the artists are absolutely brilliant and I always look forward to coming home Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to listen to the new releases. Thanks Monstercat. <3"
Kerwin Dumont," I introduced an entire grade school class to Going Quantum's episode 24 (Monstercat Guest mix of course) and they all played dodgeball while blasting it through the gym. The one kid was screaming ""I'VE NEVER HEARD THIS MUSIC BEFORE, THIS IS AWESOME!"""
Mitchel Fabian, I was greeted by a man at the door from Pizza Hut. He dropped his phone from handing us the pizzas. As the phone hit the ground the iPhone played we are won by pegboard on monstercatmedia we both stopped looked at each other and started dancing and eatin pizza saying we are one!
April Freeman,"Videoing my (at the time) 1 1/2 year old son dancing to the YouTube video of Snake Eyes. That and him recognizing the ""monstercat"" and getting excited and repeating MONSTERCAT! Over and over"
Hector Gabriel Aponte, I wont forget when Pegboards Nerds played a show in Puerto Rico i was so excited to see them play live !!!! But it got better ... so i got to see them PERFECT  but then i had the greatest idea to throw out the heart shape to see if i got there attention ... I DID!!!! When they anwsered i literally started crying of happiness and i keeped jumping as the music played... later i had another idea to show them my phone with their music ... Best idea ever they called me upstage and they started looking at all my monstercat music I was Really really really happy then when the show ended i took some a picture with them (profile picture)
Robin FromBatman,"I have to say, after my grandpa passed away in November, I really didn't know what to do with myself. I was a wreck, in more ways than one. Then one day, while driving, Spotify popped on Adventure Time by Rogue and I just felt happy and energetic and I rocked out to it on repeat for the entire half hour I was driving. Thanks for that :3"
Çompànion Cùbè,"Super depressed, nothing to cheer me up, feel like quitting. Then I suddenly find Monstercat on YouTube, I heard Light Polution by Stephen Walking, and I was hooked, I was so happy and I just couldn't quit it. Addicted since"
James Min,"My past music was Twothirds of what i wanted it to be, on Day one of my first experience with monstercat my day was like a subformat but after what happened next it was goingquantum all day. my music wasn’t varien enough it also wasn’t project 46 but only project 0, when I looked at my YouTube my 2 Iris's caught a little krewella in the shape of a cat, i felt eminence of a great Hotdate and when I Droptek-ed the video, my ear’s DOtEXE went Insan3lik3 Throttle as I heard a Muzzy Noisestorm coming through my subwoofer. Then I heard a Feint wub and a dub and as my Soulero gained a 1UP I rose out of my past Hellburg of past bad music. This was my first Direct Stereotronique experience of the *sexy beast*. Ever since then I have a reputation of being a Tut Tut child my music will forever be Ephixa-’ed to the clan of Pegboard nerds. (and yes this story is told using MC DJ names :D)"
Tj Willson,"Fondest memory was the first time I ever listened to a Monstercat release. I remember my brother's friend (who is much the lovably annoying spazz type) reacting to some electro house or something I showed him. He was super ecstatic because apparently he had found a label that had a really good selection similar to what I showed him, but better. Now being the musical elitist I am, I typically ignore that type of musical suggestion from others. I like to find undiscovered music on my own and it's something of a pride thing more than anything. But this time, it felt different. Maybe it was that he was more nagging than usual, and maybe it was just me feeling a little forgiving to someone who didn't realize what a music junkie I was, and how the music would be encountering very high standards... but regardless, I caved in. I let him hit the play button on his iPod. He played a song that I would soon learn to be ""Fire in the Hole"" by artist Pegboard Nerds, whom I had not yet heard of. The instant that first kick drum hit, I was lost in another world. This music grew inside me and I realized how dumb I was for ignoring his suggestion to Monstercat for a few months. I fell in love that very night, and I've been hanging on for the ride ever since. I've truly embraced sone music published on the label as some of my favorite tunes to this day, and I'm always pleased by new releases. It's an art that only grows more valuable over time. Not just for the crazy bass drops, but for the extreme diversity presented with each song. Ranging from intense wobbles to emotional moving melodies, Monstercat is always pushing the boundaries of what is accepted as music, and I absolutely love it. Then I get to have the pleasure of watching this same desire for music grow and develop in those around me once I introduce them to Monstercat. I can remember a time when I was driving a few friends around after school and I had put my iPod on shuffle and some Monstercat tune came on. I was verbally bombarded that instant, and I soon discovered it was a positive reaction. They asked me who the artist was, and when I told them, they asked me how I discovered it. It was then that I gave a sly grin, chuckled, then proceeded to tell the story of how I found Monstercat... It's quite powerful what you guys do. It's seriously changed lives, and not just mine. :)"
Andre Eslamian,"My fondest moment was playing with Monstercats team on league of legends and our team won, all while listening to the first plug.dj party that both Tasty and Monstercat did."
Ryan Rickett,"On the treadmil at the gym, and a gorgeous girl walks by and see's the monstercat logo on my phone, asks if im listening to the newest album, (at the time I think it was 008 not sure though). Long story short, we listened to the whole album together, came to be my gf for a while. <3MCM"
George T Staupe,"My fondest memory of mostercat was earlyer this year when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. It seemed like things in life where getting worse and worse. I had always listened to songs from you guys every so offten but then I noticed that a new song came out every monday, wednessday, and friday and I now get all exited and the first thing I do when I get home on thoes days or when I had a rough day I listen to as many of the uploaded songs as possible until my dad yells at me to get off my computer. So thank you for helping me get through the good and bad times in life monstercat."
Mischa Tee,"That the artists actually care about their fans. Tristam would hold livestreams for us, and some of the artists would play games with us, Going Quantum makes his podcasts for us. It makes me welcome to the MonsterCat family.  :)"
Harry Woodley,"Hitting the repeat button on select amazing songs on the monstercat youtube. Until the views hit over 9000. AND THEN IT WAS LIKE..
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED >:D"
Gumba Mario,"I actually got a new friend because of your awesome music <3 when we noticed we had the same taste in music we met and listened to Monstercat music and in my opinion this was the deciding reason for getting him as a new friend (actually he is my best friend now) he and me are now listening to your music every day and even now we meet to hear monstercat music together :) stay awesome and continue uploading great music, i love you :) sorry for potential bad english, i am from Germany :)"
Charlie Parsons," One day I was so stressed. I was failing school and it was about to be the weekend...and i planned to kill myself. I was surfing loosely around youtube when i came across insan3lik3s bad pitched. I had already gotten tons of reccommendations for it so i listened to it. Upon listening to it i got this strange feeling...of pure...inspiration. I wanted to go out and do something. Suddenly i realized that life was worth living. So i want to say thank you to Insan3lik3. For saving my life. 
YO FACE!"
Zack Yaeger,"I was driving through Pennsylvania. Through a huge snowstorm. I had to have spun out 2 or 3 times, somehow I lived though. But, never have I felt more alive listening to the Monstercat albums. Luckily I have like 8. So all the way through 7 hours of frightening snow, I kept my cool, with the motivation of your guys' albums, and made it to the other side! So I owe some sort of thanks to you guys!"
Billy Myers,"Being introduced to monstercat during 007 Solace album and never missing a release. Loving every song that has been released and being extremly excited for the next release. Thank you monstercat, and never stop releasing music!"
Tyler Armbruster,"Duffy covering Monstercat songs, definitely. seeing 2 of my most beloved things come together in such a beautiful way, blew my mind."
Adam Dabrowski,"Monstercat helped me discover many artists like Tristam, Varien, Ephixia. Before it, I didnt even listen to dubstep, now I do. THANKS MONSTERCAT"
Issa Chowdhury,"I have been watching and listening to the channel from the start and well there is alot of good memory's Project46 ""Slide"" Ephixa dubstep"" killed rock n roll"" Hellberg ""Stockholm"" But atm I've got Rogue Adventure time, Dream and Exogenesis in addition to I.Y.F.F.E, Au5 & Auratic - Sweet stuck in my head. Theres no end to its. And i love it"
Charles Zeller,"When i first came into the channel on youtube my first song was Disconnected, that made my mind get blown so therefore I decided to keep a check in and out of the channel and then I became a fan. It's amazing and you guys are doing great and hope you keep giving us Monstercat"
Nathan Johnson,My fondest memory from the past year and a half is getting to hear feint's music. I started listening a lot more to dnb and you guys are the one that helped me find out what type of music i like. So thanks a million and have another great year and a half.
Andrew Joseph,"Arion, Monstercat, u are the reason I love dubstep so much, cold blood and ice cream cones hooked my for life!"
Nick Sotana," I remember when i first listened to ""dubstep"" and like most people, it was Skrillex. I liked dubstep, electro, house for a while but i was looking for the PERFECT artist, one who ii could listem to everyday and still enjoy it every time. This. This is when i found monster cat. Thanks to my bestfriend, the first song i listened to on the MonsterCatMedia YouTube channel was Follow Me by Tristam. For then on it was ALL monstercat. What i love about Monstercat, is that it dose'nt focus on ONE thing. It expands and is only getting bigger, I can always find ENDLESS amounts of music here and its always good! I have'nt found one TERRIBLE song up to this date. And i dont think i will for a while"
James Flower, Watching an Athene video which had Blow ExXxplode by Arion on.. Checking out the MonsterCat channel.. Loving it and now having an hour dedicated to MonsterCat at each party me and my friend go to taking over the speakers :) getting the logo tattooed this coming Easter too :) when my student loan comes in anyway!
Janaki Spetsnaz,"going to beta nightclub to see stephen walking, going quantam, tristam and noisestorm. i never go to nightclubs xD"
Michael Barrett,"I've just been getting EDM when I found your channel, so I decided to check it out. All the music was so good, and the artists are amazing. EDM is now my favorite genre and I listen to barely anything else, thanks to the amazing people at Monstercat. I remember driving to North Carolina during Christmas time with my parents, while listening to all the Monstercat albums in order, from 01 to my very favorite, 08. Well, it was pretty much the best 7-hour car ride ever. I love you Monstercat!"
Fraser Martin,"when The Syndicate Project started playing Noisestorm's renegade and let it roar, got me into noisestorm and monstercat, ever from then ive loved all the artist under monstercats label and loved syndicate :D"
Nathaniel John Smith,"I don't know my best memory. All the songs are one-of-a-kind and they all deserve to be recognized. Not all dubstep songs are special, but you changed that when I first heard Noisestorm, TutTut child, Ephixa, and all the rest."
Andre Mariucci,"i remember when i was watching IIJERiiCHOII on youtube as usual, when he started playing music in the background, amazing music, music where i came back to that cometary just to hear that music again. i had to find out who done this music, so i showed the videos to all my friends asking them if they know who done this, but none of them did. eventually i looked in the description of the videos and saw there was a link in the description to the music video (derp face), i was so happy when i first heard Project 46, then i listened to some related videos, Pegboard Nerds, Rouge, Ephixa, i loved what i was hearing, then i realized that these were all uploaded by the same youtube channel....Monstercat Media....my love for monstercat had begun."
Nick Pasquarelli,I would have to say during the Indegogo campaign was my favorite memory with Monstercat. I loved being able to help you guys so much and it was great to see us all go up and beyond what your initial goal was! The perks didn't hurt too (and I can't wait for the poster/slide) but overall it was great to see the Monstercat family come out in full force.
Logan Bedell,"Well.... I remember going on youtube, i saw a song called lost woods dubstep remix by Ephixa. When i listened to it, i got this amazing feeling that i have only gotten from two songs(lost woods dubstep remix by Ephixa and backlash by Noisestorm) it sent like a shock throughout my body.. After that i went onto itunes and looked up Ephixa. Monstercat came up. I bought like 4 albums. I liked most of the songs, now i am a fan of Monstercat."
Jake Cairns,"My favourite moment was when I first found Monstercat on YouTube (Just after 005 was released) and then buying every album to date :D It's amazing to see how far the Monstercat label has come and just how huge it has become, by far the best on YouTube. It seems like now all I do is listen to your music when working and before I go to bed :P Monstercat was what brought me into the world of EDM and here I shall rest on saying that EDM is the future of Music and hopefully it won't be long until we celebrate the 1 million subscriber milestone :D"
Loren Weisser,"I was Dancing at the bus stop (poppin), when the desk girl inside the dentists office window got the dentist to start recording me on his IPhone. Without letting on that I had noticed, I continued to bust it out."
Nando Schalks,"When I discovered Monstercat, I immediately subscribed and started listening to all their old song, realising how much I love DnB. Bring it back - TwoThirds was probably my favorite DnB song ever. I found out what I really like about music and now I'm subscribed to many other music channels too. This way I also made many friends all around the world (via Youtube), who share the same music taste as me. Thanks for sharing so much awesome music ;D"
Lars VU,"discovered my favorite producer of all times; tut tut child, thanks to Monstercat's YouTube chanel . i think the first tut tut child- song i ever listened to was mysterious stranger . from that moment i was hooked and loved all his tracks , especially fat cat adventures and dragon pirates . thanks for that Monstercat"
Henrik Arne Lie,"I had been a sub of Ephixa for a while, but for some reason never discovered Monstercat. But suddenly one day I discovered monstercat, a few songs away from the end of album 009. I got greeted in the subbox with Nightfall by Rouge, I quickly fell in love with he song and Monstercat! And from that day, I've been an extreme fan of Monstercat!"
Marius Hess,"I'm glad I found Monstercat pretty much at the beginning. While browsing randomly I found Ephixa and his Legend of Zelda remixes, which blew me away instantly. I found his YouTube channel and through that the Monstercat channel, i think it was around the time the 3rd Album got released. Since then, I never miss any uploads of Monstercat, I sit in front of my pc and smash the refresh-button until the new song is out :b Every artist has got his own style and that's what makes Monstercat so unique. It's very hard to find good music nowadays, I am just happy that I found your channel. Without this music, my life would'nt be as it is now, thank you guys and keep continuing!"
Chen Ricky Chen,"When I first found out about the monstercat family, I was searching for my favourite artist at the time. I searched for noisestorm when I saw an interesting video of a cat and penguin with an AK on it. That was when I heard Ephixa's some wobbles and my love sprouted from there. My favourite moments of the year are when the tracks are free on monstercat. As a unemployed highschool student, my main way of downloading music is by pirating but with monstercat and their free releases I am able to download all their songs without guilt. Of course, I still feel bad because I can't help support the artists right now but when I find I job, my first paycheck will go toward your albums to support all of my favourite artists :)"
Gino Fubel," I can't sleep without music, that's fact. And as all of you should know, surrounding noises (including music) influences your dreams... and sometimes I realise, when I'm driving a car for example, ""Hey, wow, I like that song, gonna listen to it later again.. wait, what, that's from Monstercat, isn't it?"""
Marc Roman Barcelo,"Last year i discovered monstercat, which i loved. And I had a CD in my car with some my favourite monstercat artists (two-thirds, tristam, muzzy...) In fact, the car belongs to my mother (I`m 18). My mum found the CD in the car, began to listen to the playlists and now is as fan of monstercat as me!"
Richard Parnham, The deep and thoughtful meanings that go with so many of these amazing songs. The fact that as a family we are expanding our horizons and opening new doors for people giving them chances they thought nearly impossible. I've been here since 005 and haven't missed a song since. Congratulations Monstercat <3 AZEDIA! I loved precipitate :)
Tommy Pauliner,I found Monstercat with the help of Ephixa aprox a year ago. I really love Monstercat and i would make anything to win something but my family is really poor and i live far far away from monstercat:(... Congratz monstercat . You're the best . Thanks for making me happy day by day with your awesome uploads. Love u ( not gay ! )...
Dean Snorlax Bassan,"Getting the monstercat 007 Solace and repeating it over and over and over for 1000's of time, and then over again. Dancing my ass off in the car flipping bass hands to people through the window and laughing so hard from people's reaction! 
You guys bring in me so much joy for making addictive dance music. And so much inspiration and hope, to see how you got so big and made all of your artists so so huge! Showing to 500,000 people and more that you can do it no matter what! 
You are the revolution, thanks for being yourself! You are in my opinion the happiest most awesome thing that happened to music industry."
Aleksandar Vasilev," Lol i was in history class when i went to my teacher's laptop and i opend his music folder and it was full of monstercat music! I love him now, its fun cuz we talk about songs and artits when we meet :D"
Simon Andersson Tholin,"These musicstyles are not old.... A few years ago nobody knew about EDM or Drumstep. And that was really good. It was ""my"" music. But then Monstercat came and it changed everything. And that was even better!! This is an adventure of epic proportions. This is big, really big. And I am proud of being a part of this generation and be able to say that I was there when Monstercat happened! <3"
George Thomas,"The first time i discovered monstercat, I pulled an all nighter,went down the list of EVERY song, listened to them all, whilst raving around the house. needless to say my parents were not impressed. this was about a year ago and i can't believe how far we've all come!<3"

Eetu Kurkela," I was biking home very, very fast and i had some music from MonsterCatMedia playing through my earphones. :D I can't remember the exact songs but I was very happy at the moment and became even happier and had goosebumps and chills all theoughout the journey home. (I was 11 km from home :P) it felt like I was the only moving thing since I didn't see any people or cars cycling home, it was a really beatiful day and the sun was setting so the sky looked absolutely amazing and it felt like a music video, with MonsterCat music! It has stuck in my memory and I will remember it my whole life :)"
Brian Gonzalez-Montoya,"I remember finding Going Quantum's page and listening to the mixes he had. I was in love immediately. Then I fount he podcasts, and then monstercat media. I've shown monstercat music to a lot of friends and school, and have started world domination here. It's now extremely popular here, and I still love it. There's also been a lot of praise for Tut Tut Child. The last song that played in my friend's car before it was stolen and involved in a high speed chase was Broadside Bordello. It went out in style."
Miklós Mándoki,"Is there really one great moment to pick? Well, it's really a tie between dethroning on iTunes and the United googlemaps webapp campaign thingy :) both showed how awesome this community is! :)"
David Forbes,"I just love the pure happiness that the music has brought me. I used to hate electronic music, especially dubstep. Now I listen to Monstercat everyday, no joke. So, I guess discovering it was the best moment for me. I don't know what my life would have been like if Monstercat never existed! Thank you, guys!"
Jacob Werbeckes,"The best part about many of the songs featured is that I can feel the artist's feelings that went into making the song. As an example, Rogue says that every song he writes is based off of what he's feeling at the time. Through his songs I can feel what he felt at the time of writing, and I love every minute of it."
Ronnie Entner,"I remember when I found Monstercat from the IPL 5 stream. The whole channel was like a playlist that I had personally created, every song was that good. I haven't stopped talking about Monstercat ever since then."
Lucas Butchko,"My friend first introduced me to EDM about a year ago, by showing me DotEXE and Rogue. They instantly became my favorite artists on my phone.I then became more and more involved with Monstercat, and fell in love with even more artists, like Tut Tut Child and Day One. Now, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I sit on my laptop, refreshing YouTube every 5 minutes until the new release was up. Although I haven't been part of the Monstercat family for very long, I enjoy all of the new releases just as much as the rest of the fans"
Austin JerryBruh Zell,"I was in the hospital when ""Adventure Time"" by: Rogue came out. It helped me get through because of the sound of the cheerful and meaningful music. I am proud to be a part of the Monstercat family."
MacKenzie Ross Todd ,My fondest memory must have been when i was back in grade 9 i had no good music to get me through my work or tests than when i discovered MonsterCat i downloaded as much as i could. I think it even improved my test scores!
Jake Baum,"Well actually, I make fond memories of Monstercat every night. I will feel overwhelmed with finding a job and schoolwork. Then I grab my iPod and my headphones and listen to AZEDIA, Tut Tut Child, Ramses B, Muzzy, Rogue, Ephixa, DotEXE, Tristam, and most importantly,Insan3Lik3, and just let every worry I have in life drift away. 
Monstercat, you allow me to find peace in an ever moving world. thank you so much for that."
Ray Fritterman Kincaid ,"Fondest memory was waking up on my birthday last year and seeing the first happy birthdays on my page from Mr FijiWiji,Stephen Walking,Feint,Bustre,Tristam,Going Quantum,Tut Tut Child and TwoThirds."
Jesse Whitinger,"When I heard that phenominal flute drop that Stephen Walking produced in his song ""Move"" I just had to learn to play it, and so I did. Once I learned it on my trumpet, I wrote sheet music for the song on a bunch of different instruments and even percussion. Now, me an my friends jam to one of the most unique tracks I've heard in a long time."
Yg Dv," Airport, Summer break, Arion. This was my first experience with MC, so what happened? I listened, I absorbed, and loved it. This was my favorite vacation, because at least everyday. I listened to every monstercat song. Now, I follow, sleep, dream and love Monstercat. I even printed a 3d Model of one that is in my vase, staring at me as I type every character of this post. It stares with. recommendation. I will always be part of, Monstercat."
